# Banking Application – Java Assignment

This is a simple **Banking Application** built in Java for my assignment.
It lets a user create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check account details, and update contact information.

### How it works

* When you run the program, a menu appears with options like create account, deposit, withdraw, view details, and update contact.
* Each account is stored in an **array**, and every new account gets a unique account number (starting from 1001).
* The program uses **basic Java concepts** such as classes, methods, arrays, strings, loops, and conditional statements.

### Features

1. **Create Account** – Enter name, initial deposit, email, and phone number.
2. **Deposit Money** – Add money to an existing account.
3. **Withdraw Money** – Withdraw cash if you have enough balance.
4. **View Account Details** – Shows account holder info and balance.
5. **Update Contact Details** – Change email and phone number.

### Why this project

The goal was to practice:

* Writing and organizing Java classes
* Using arrays to store multiple objects
* Handling user input with `Scanner`
* Applying simple decision-making (`if-else`) and loops (`do-while`)
